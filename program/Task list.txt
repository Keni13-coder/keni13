Task 1


Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.



Task 2


Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]



Task 3


This kata is about multiplying a given number by eight if it is an even number and by nine otherwise.


Task 4


All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.
Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.
Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.


Task 5


Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.



Task 6


Write a function named setAlarm which receives two parameters. The first parameter, employed, is true whenever you are employed and the second parameter, vacation is true whenever you are on vacation.

The function should return true if you are employed and not on vacation (because these are the circumstances under which you need to set an alarm). It should return false otherwise. Examples:

setAlarm(true, true) -> false
setAlarm(false, true) -> false
setAlarm(false, false) -> false
setAlarm(true, false) -> true

Task 7


Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.


Task 8


A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return True if yes, False otherwise 


Task 9


Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

For example,

[True,  True,  True,  False,
  True,  True,  True,  True ,
  True,  False, True,  False,
  True,  False, False, True ,
  True,  True,  True,  True ,
  False, False, True,  True]
The correct answer would be 17.

Hint: Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined


Task 10

Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order


Task 12

Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

Examples(Operator, value1, value2) --> output
('+', 4, 7) --> 11
('-', 15, 18) --> -3
('*', 5, 5) --> 25
('/', 49, 7) --> 7


Task 13

Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

Style Points
Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

Task 14

We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

Task 20


You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.


Task 23


Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:
Example(Input --> Output)

["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at


Task 24


Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

Examples
Input: [1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1]
Output: 9.2

Input: []
Output: 0

Input: [-2.398]
Output: -2.398

Assumptions
You can assume that you are only given numbers.
You cannot assume the size of the array.
You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empty, return 0.
What We're Testing
We're testing basic loops and math operations. This is for beginners who are just learning loops and math operations.
Advanced users may find this extremely easy and can easily write this in one line.

Task 11

Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] should return 3453455.


Task 15

A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

Task
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

Examples
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false


Task 16


There is a bus moving in the city which takes and drops some people at each bus stop.

You are provided with a list (or array) of integer pairs. Elements of each pair represent the number of people that get on the bus (the first item) and the number of people that get off the bus (the second item) at a bus stop.

Your task is to return the number of people who are still on the bus after the last bus stop (after the last array). Even though it is the last bus stop, the bus might not be empty and some people might still be inside the bus, they are probably sleeping there :D

Take a look on the test cases.

Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the returned integer can't be negative.

The second value in the first pair in the array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.


Task 17

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.


Task 18


Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

Happy Coding!


Task 19


Implement a function that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The function should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).



Task 21


ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

Examples (Input --> Output)
"1234"   -->  true
"12345"  -->  false
"a234"   -->  false


Task 22


Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.: (Input --> Output)

1 -->  1
2 --> 3 + 5 = 8


Task 25


Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

More similar exercise are found here: http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)

Example: (input --> output)

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"


Task 26

Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

i.e.


Task 27


In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?

At the end of the first year there will be: 
1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants

At the end of the 2nd year there will be: 
1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)

At the end of the 3rd year there will be:
1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213

It will need 3 entire years.
More generally given parameters:

p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to equal or surpass)

the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.

aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)

Examples:
nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15
nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10
Note:
Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.


Task 28



Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.


Task 29


Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"
Link to Jaden's former Twitter account @officialjaden via archive.org



Task 34


You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.
#Examples:

Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"
#Input

A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.

#Output

The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

Выпуск
Выходные данные будут состоять из списка строковых значений (в Haskell и C: или ), указывающих, должен ли соответствующий элемент быть помещен в старшую или открытую категорию.OpenSenior

Example
input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]



Task 39


Your task is to write a function which returns the sum of following series upto nth term(parameter).

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 +...
Rules:
You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

If the given value is 0 then it should return 0.00

You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

Examples:(Input --> Output)
1 --> 1 --> "1.00"
2 --> 1 + 1/4 --> "1.25"
5 --> 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 --> "1.57"


Task 40


Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

Examples: (Input --> Output)

[] --> []
["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]



Task 44 
Mr. Scrooge has a sum of money 'P' that he wants to invest. Before he does, he wants to know how many years 'Y' this sum 'P' has to be kept in the bank in order for it to amount to a desired sum of money 'D'.

The sum is kept for 'Y' years in the bank where interest 'I' is paid yearly. After paying taxes 'T' for the year the new sum is re-invested.

Note to Tax: not the invested principal is taxed, but only the year's accrued interest

Example:

  Let P be the Principal = 1000.00      
  Let I be the Interest Rate = 0.05      
  Let T be the Tax Rate = 0.18      
  Let D be the Desired Sum = 1100.00


After 1st Year -->
  P = 1041.00
After 2nd Year -->
  P = 1083.86
After 3rd Year -->
  P = 1128.30
Thus Mr. Scrooge has to wait for 3 years for the initial principal to amount to the desired sum.

Your task is to complete the method provided and return the number of years 'Y' as a whole in order for Mr. Scrooge to get the desired sum.

Assumption: Assume that Desired Principal 'D' is always greater than the initial principal. However it is best to take into consideration that if Desired Principal 'D' is equal to Principal 'P' this should return 0 Years.

Task 30

Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

Examples
"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.


Task 32


In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

"a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

Example
alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" ( as a string )

Task 41


Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci.

As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]
But what if we started with [0, 0, 1] as a signature? As starting with [0, 1] instead of [1, 1] basically shifts the common Fibonacci sequence by once place, you may be tempted to think that we would get the same sequence shifted by 2 places, but that is not the case and we would get:

[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]
Well, you may have guessed it by now, but to be clear: you need to create a fibonacci function that given a signature array/list, returns the first n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence.

Signature will always contain 3 numbers; n will always be a non-negative number; if n == 0, then return an empty array (except in C return NULL) and be ready for anything else which is not clearly specified ;)

If you enjoyed this kata more advanced and generalized version of it can be found in the Xbonacci kata

Task 43 

A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.


Task 45


In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up. 
Rules
 1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.

 2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat
Example
wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]


Task 46 


You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).



Task 47


Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

Examples
Valid arrays
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]




Task 49

Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example (Input --> Output):

39 --> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit)
999 --> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2)
4 --> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number)




Task 51  


Implement the function unique_in_order which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

For example:

unique_in_order('AAAABBBCCDAABBB') == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
unique_in_order('ABBCcAD')         == ['A', 'B', 'C', 'c', 'A', 'D']
unique_in_order([1, 2, 2, 3, 3])   == [1, 2, 3]
unique_in_order((1, 2, 2, 3, 3))   == [1, 2, 3]

Task 54


iven an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Examples
[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).




Task 55
The number 
89
89 is the first integer with more than one digit that fulfills the property partially introduced in the title of this kata. What's the use of saying "Eureka"? Because this sum gives the same number: 
89 = (8 ** 1) + (9 **2)
135 = (1 ** 1) + (3 ** 2) + (5 ** 3)


Task 56



You are given an array(list) strarr of strings and an integer k. Your task is to return the first longest string consisting of k consecutive strings taken in the array.
n being the length of the string array, if n = 0 or k > n or k <= 0 return "" (return Nothing in Elm, "nothing" in Erlang).

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.




Task 42


This time we want to write calculations using functions and get the results. Let's have a look at some examples:

seven(times(five())) # must return 35
four(plus(nine())) # must return 13
eight(minus(three())) # must return 5
six(divided_by(two())) # must return 3
Requirements:

There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, divided_by
Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
Division should be integer division. For example, this should return 2, not 2.666666...:
eight(divided_by(three()))





Task 48 
The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence (Fn):

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, ...

such as

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

Given a number, say prod (for product), we search two Fibonacci numbers F(n) and F(n+1) verifying

F(n) * F(n+1) = prod.

Your function productFib takes an integer (prod) and returns an array:

[F(n), F(n+1), true] or {F(n), F(n+1), 1} or (F(n), F(n+1), True)
depending on the language if F(n) * F(n+1) = prod.

If you don't find two consecutive F(n) verifying F(n) * F(n+1) = prodyou will return

[F(n), F(n+1), false] or {F(n), F(n+1), 0} or (F(n), F(n+1), False)
F(n) being the smallest one such as F(n) * F(n+1) > prod.

Some Examples of Return:
(depend on the language)

productFib(714) # should return (21, 34, true), 
                # since F(8) = 21, F(9) = 34 and 714 = 21 * 34

productFib(800) # should return (34, 55, false), 
                # since F(8) = 21, F(9) = 34, F(10) = 55 and 21 * 34 < 800 < 34 * 55
-----
productFib(714) # should return [21, 34, true], 
productFib(800) # should return [34, 55, false], 
-----
productFib(714) # should return {21, 34, 1}, 
productFib(800) # should return {34, 55, 0},        
-----
productFib(714) # should return {21, 34, true}, 
productFib(800) # should return {34, 55, false}, 
Note:
You can see examples for your language in "Sample Tests".




Task 52


ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is an example of the Caesar cipher.

Create a function that takes a string and returns the string ciphered with Rot13. If there are numbers or special characters included in the string, they should be returned as they are. Only letters from the latin/english alphabet should be shifted, like in the original Rot13 "implementation".

Please note that using encode is considered cheating.

Task 36


Given an n x n array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.

array = [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
For better understanding, please follow the numbers of the next array consecutively:

array = [[1,2,3],
         [8,9,4],
         [7,6,5]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
This image will illustrate things more clearly:


NOTE: The idea is not sort the elements from the lowest value to the highest; the idea is to traverse the 2-d array in a clockwise snailshell pattern.

NOTE 2: The 0x0 (empty matrix) is represented as en empty array inside an array [[]].                                     


Task 50


A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either

individual integers
or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints. It is not considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For example "12,13,15-17"
Complete the solution so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format.
solution([-10, -9, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20])
# returns "-10--8,-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20"
